# React + Vite

# assignmen 1 
# find the factorial (must use useMemo)

# assignment 2 
# In this assignment, you will create a component that renders a large list of sentences and includes an input field for filtering these items. 
# The goal is to use useMemo to optimize the filtering process, ensuring the list is only re-calculated when necessary (e.g., when the filter criteria changes).
# You will learn something new here, specifically how you have to pass more than one value in the dependency array

# assignment3
# You have been given a list of items you shopped from the grocery store
# You need to calculate the total amount of money you spent

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
